# Management-System


PMS or Projects Management System App is a website for managing all your projects and creating to-do lists for your projects, and tasks. For the PMS website, I used Python for all functionalities, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.

Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the Custom Relationship Management App.

The applications that make up the project are the following:

• Core - this is the main application of the project where is stored the main template for the front page of the Projects Management System App and the Django template for the front page.

• Account - this is the app of the project where I created the functionalities for login, register, and logout.

• Projects - this is the central app of the project where you can create projects, view the to-do list and project details, and edit or delete them. 
 edit
• Todo_lis - this is the app of the project where I created the functionalities for creating a to-do list, viewing the to-do list, and editing or deleting de to-do list.

• Tasks - this is the last app of the project where I integrated the practicalities of creating tasks, the possibility of marking as done the tasks if you completed them, editing, and deleting the task.

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates used in this project weren't created by me and the website design wasn't a priority for me, I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
